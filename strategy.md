## 1️⃣ Define your **North Star**

This is the anchor for all decisions.

Ask yourself:

* In **3–5 years**, what do I want to be known for?
* What kind of problems do I enjoy solving?
* What lifestyle do I want? (money, flexibility, impact, leadership, calm vs fast-paced)

Example:

* “Senior backend engineer leading system design decisions”
* “Tech lead in a SaaS company”
* “Independent consultant with strong Laravel + architecture skills”

👉 Write **one clear sentence**. If it’s vague, everything else will be vague.

---

## 2️⃣ Know your **current position**

Strategy starts with brutal honesty.

Split this into 3 parts:

### Skills

* What am I **strong** at?
* What am I **okay** at?
* What am I **weak / avoiding**?

### Experience

* What have I *actually shipped*?
* What decisions did I own?
* Where did I add real business value?

### Gaps

* What do people at my target level know that I don’t?

👉 This gives you the **delta** between now and your North Star.

---

## 3️⃣ Choose a **career lane** (don’t drift)

Many people fail because they try everything.

Pick **one primary lane**:

* Individual Contributor (deep technical)
* Tech Lead / Architect
* Engineering Manager
* Founder / Indie builder

You can pivot later—but **not now**.

For example:

> “For the next 18 months, I optimize for becoming a strong Senior Backend / Tech Lead.”

---

## 4️⃣ Convert goals into **capabilities**

Titles don’t matter. Capabilities do.

For each target role, ask:

* What must I be able to do **without help**?
* What decisions am I expected to make?
* What mistakes am I expected to *avoid*?

Example (Senior Backend):

* Design scalable APIs
* Make database tradeoffs
* Understand caching, queues, consistency
* Communicate technical decisions clearly

👉 These become your **learning roadmap**.

---

## 5️⃣ Build a **learning + execution loop**

Learning without execution is fake progress.

Use this cycle:

1. Learn a concept (system design, performance, architecture)
2. Apply it to:

   * Your current job
   * A side project
   * Refactoring something real
3. Write / explain what you learned (even privately)

Rule:

> If it didn’t change how you code or decide, you didn’t learn it.

---

## 6️⃣ Optimize for **leverage**, not effort

Hard work ≠ smart work.

High-leverage moves:

* Working on systems used by many users
* Owning critical features
* Writing internal docs
* Making architectural decisions
* Mentoring juniors

Low-leverage:

* Only fixing small bugs
* Staying in comfort zone
* Learning random tech with no plan

---

## 7️⃣ Review quarterly (strategy ≠ fixed)

Every 3 months, ask:

* Am I closer to my North Star?
* What gave me the most growth?
* What should I **stop** doing?

Career strategy is **iterative**, not a prison.

---

## 8️⃣ Write it down (this matters)

A strategy that’s not written is just hope.

Your plan should fit on **one page**:

* North Star
* Current level
* Skill gaps
* Next 3-month focus
* One measurable outcome

---

### If you want

I can:

* Help you **define your North Star** based on your background
* Turn this into a **1-page career strategy document**
* Map a **12-month roadmap** for backend / Laravel / architecture growth

Just tell me where you *think* you are right now 👀
